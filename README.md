<h1>lmono</h1>
This is a framework of LiDAR-monocular camera fusion system. Visual information from monocular camera assist in scene recognization in LiDAR odometry and dense mapping.
automatic calibration between LiDAR and a single camera is procided as well.

- [x] laser odometry
- [x] scene recognition/ loop detection
- [x] automatic and real-time calibration
- [x] 3D dense map with color information
